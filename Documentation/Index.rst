Sphinx TYPO3 Theme Rendering Test
=================================

This repository demonstrates how reST constructs look like when rendered with
the `t3SphinxThemeRtd <https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/t3SphinxThemeRtd>`__ theme.

.. important::

   Due to some included extensions in Settings.cfg, this will not render with
   older versions of the Docker image.

See `_buildinfo <_buildinfo>`_
